**Urho3D Rebel Fork** aka **rbfx** is an experimental fork of [Urho3D](http://urho3d.github.io/) game engine.

[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/rokups/rbfx/wiki) contains fork-specific documentation including [build instructions](https://github.com/rokups/rbfx/wiki/first-application) and differences between original project and **rbfx**.

[Doxygen Documentation](https://rbfx.github.io/) is cloned from original project and is not updated (yet?), although it still contains relevant information regarding core functionality of the engine.

Note that **rbfx** is undergoing active developement. Please report all spotted bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/rokups/rbfx/issues).
