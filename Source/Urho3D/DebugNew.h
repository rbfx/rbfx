// This file overrides global new to provide file and line information to allocations for easier memory leak detection on MSVC
// compilers. Do not include this file in a compilation unit that uses placement new. Include this file last after other
// includes; e.g. Bullet's include files will cause a compile error if this file is included before them. Also note that
// using DebugNew.h is by no means mandatory, but just a debugging convenience.
