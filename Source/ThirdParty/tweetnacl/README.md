# tweetnacl

WIP node bindings tweetnacl (minimal version of nacl - only one c file)

tweetnacl has a lot less moving parts than sodium/nacl,
so I figure this would be much easier to build portably.

This is my first c binding. some macros copypasta'd from [sodium](https://github.com/paixaop/node-sodium)
