\f[C]
#include <embree3/rtcore.h>

void rtcOccluded1(
  RTCScene scene,
  struct RTCIntersectContext* context,
  struct RTCRay* ray
);

.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]rtcOccluded1\f[R] function checks for a single ray
(\f[C]ray\f[R] argument) whether there is any hit with the scene
(\f[C]scene\f[R] argument).
.PP
The user must initialize the ray origin (\f[C]org\f[R] ray member), ray
direction (\f[C]dir\f[R] ray member), ray segment (\f[C]tnear\f[R],
\f[C]tfar\f[R] ray members), and must set the ray flags to \f[C]0\f[R]
(\f[C]flags\f[R] ray member).
If the scene contains motion blur geometries, also the ray time
(\f[C]time\f[R] ray member) must be initialized to a value in the range
[0,\[u2006]1].
If ray masks are enabled at compile time, the ray mask (\f[C]mask\f[R]
ray member) must be initialized as well.
The ray segment must be in the range [0,\[u2006]\[if]], thus ranges that
start behind the ray origin are not valid, but ranges can reach to
infinity.
See Section [RTCRay] for the ray layout description.
.PP
When no intersection is found, the ray data is not updated.
In case a hit was found, the \f[C]tfar\f[R] component of the ray is set
to \f[C]\-inf\f[R].
.PP
The implementation makes no guarantees that primitives whose hit
distance is exactly at (or very close to) \f[C]tnear\f[R] or
\f[C]tfar\f[R] are hit or missed.
If you want to exclude intersections at \f[C]tnear\f[R] just pass a
slightly enlarged \f[C]tnear\f[R], and if you want to include
intersections at \f[C]tfar\f[R] pass a slightly enlarged \f[C]tfar\f[R].

The ray must be aligned to 16 bytes.
.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
For performance reasons this function does not do any error checks, thus
will not set any error flags on failure.
